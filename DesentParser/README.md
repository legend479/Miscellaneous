## Description

The `checkGrammar` function in this Python program is designed to parse a sequence of tokens generated from a source code and determine whether the code adheres to a specific grammar defined in the program. The grammar checks for a specific pattern in the code, which includes conditional statements (if-else) and expressions.

## Grammar Rules Used
Start -> Statement
Statement -> "if" A | y Statement | y
A -> y "o" A | y Statement | y Statement "else" Statement

where y is an Statement Alphabets and o is a logical operator (e.g., <, >, +, - ,^ , * , /).
## Usage

To use the `checkGrammar` function, follow these steps:

1. **Input:** The function expects a list of tokens as its input. These tokens should be generated by the `tokenize` function, which breaks down the source code into a list of token pairs (token type and token value).

2. **Calling the Function:** You can call the `checkGrammar` function by passing the list of tokens as an argument.

   ```python
   result = checkGrammar(tokens)
   ```

3. **Output:** The function returns a boolean value:
   - `True` if the input code adheres to the defined grammar rules.
   - `False` if there are syntax errors in the code or if the code does not match the expected grammar.

4. **Syntax Errors:** If there are syntax errors in the code, the function will print error messages to the console, indicating the location of the error in terms of token positions.

5. **Syntax Warnings:** If there are syntax warnings (e.g., incomplete clauses before the 'else' keyword), the function will print warning messages to the console.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `checkGrammar` function:

```python
# Tokenize the input code
tokens = tokenize("if x + 3.1 print else if test else if x + 3 * 4 < 2 ok")

# Check the grammar
result = checkGrammar(tokens)

if result:
    print("The code adheres to the defined grammar.")
else:
    print("There are syntax errors in the code.")
```

In this example, the function will tokenize the input code and check whether it adheres to the grammar rules. The result will indicate whether the code is valid or contains syntax errors.

## Notes

- The function also handles syntax warnings, such as incomplete clauses before the 'else' keyword. These warnings provide additional information about potential issues in the code.

- Make sure to review the code of the `checkGrammar` function and the `tokenize` function to understand the specific grammar rules and token types used in your program.
