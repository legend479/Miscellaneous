    <h1>Terms and Policies</h1>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to our website, where we take our policies as seriously as a cat<br>
      takes a bath. By using this website, you agree to comply with our terms<br>
      and policies, which are subject to change as frequently as a chameleon<br>
      changes color.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Use of Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use cookies to track your behavior on our website, but don't worry,<br>
      they're not the chocolate chip kind. We promise not to sell your<br>
      information to third-party websites unless they offer us a lifetime supply<br>
      of pizza.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Content and Copyright</h2>
    <p>
      All content on our website is either created by us or stolen from the<br>
      internet. You are not allowed to copy or reproduce any of our content<br>
      unless you're willing to pay us in hugs and high-fives.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      We are not responsible for any damages or injuries caused by the use of<br>
      our website, unless you count the time you spent laughing at our jokes as<br>
      a personal injury.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>5. Termination of Service</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to terminate our services at any time, especially if<br>
      we run out of coffee. In the event of termination, we will delete all of<br>
      your personal information and replace it with pictures of cute puppies.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These terms and policies are governed by the laws of the universe, which<br>
      are subject to change at any time by a higher power. If you have any<br>
      disputes with us, you agree to settle them in a dance-off.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about our terms and policies, please<br>
      don't hesitate to contact us. We promise to respond to your emails within<br>
      24 hours, or 48 hours if we accidentally fall asleep on our keyboards.<br>
